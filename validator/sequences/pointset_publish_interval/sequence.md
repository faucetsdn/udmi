Check handling of sample_rate_sec and sample_limit_sec

1. Wait for config sync
1. Update config before receive at least 4 pointset events:
    * Add `pointset.sample_rate_sec` = `8`
    * Add `pointset.sample_limit_sec` = `5`
1. Wait for receive at least 4 pointset events
1. Check that time period between successive pointset events is between 5 and 8 seconds
1. Wait for config sync
1. Update config before receive at least 4 pointset events:
    * Set `pointset.sample_rate_sec` = `18`
    * Set `pointset.sample_limit_sec` = `15`
1. Wait for receive at least 4 pointset events
