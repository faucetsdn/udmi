## endpoint_redirect_and_restart (ALPHA)

1. Wait for initial last_config matches config timestamp
1. Update config mirroring config false:
    * Add `blobset` = { "blobs": { "_iot_endpoint_config": { "phase": `final`, "generation": `blob generation`, "sha256": `blob data hash`, "url": `endpoint url` } } }
1. Wait for blobset phase is apply and stateStatus is null
1. Check that no interesting system status
1. Wait for blobset phase is final and stateStatus is null
1. Check that no interesting system status
1. Wait for alternate last_config matches config timestamp
1. Update config before endpoint config blobset state not defined:
    * Remove `blobset.blobs._iot_endpoint_config`
1. Wait for endpoint config blobset state not defined
1. Wait for last_start is not zero
1. Check that initial count is greater than 0
1. Update config before system mode is ACTIVE:
    * Add `system.operation.mode` = `active`
1. Wait for system mode is ACTIVE
1. Update config before system mode is INITIAL:
    * Set `system.operation.mode` = `restart`
1. Wait for system mode is INITIAL
1. Check that restart count increased by one
1. Update config before system mode is ACTIVE:
    * Set `system.operation.mode` = `active`
1. Wait for system mode is ACTIVE
1. Wait for last_config is newer than previous last_config before abort
1. Wait for last_config is newer than previous last_config after abort
1. Wait for last_start is newer than previous last_start
1. Update config mirroring config true:
    * Add `blobset.blobs._iot_endpoint_config` = { "phase": `final`, "generation": `blob generation`, "sha256": `blob data hash`, "url": `endpoint url` }
1. Wait for blobset phase is apply and stateStatus is null
1. Check that no interesting system status
1. Wait for blobset phase is final and stateStatus is null
1. Check that no interesting system status
1. Wait for restored last_config matches config timestamp
