# Development

## Schema Documentation

The schema documentation in [`gencode/docs`](../../gencode/docs) must be kept up to date with any changes to the schema. Any additions to the schema should also include [annotations](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/json-schema-validation.html#rfc.section.9.1) to describe the new elements. The updated documentation is generated by running the script `bin/gendocs` and its output committed to the repository with the changes. Required python dependencies are in [`etc/requirements.txt`](../../etc/requirements.txt) which must be installed for the script to run.

### Troubleshooting

If documentation CI tests are failing, check the basic system requirements -
python modules installed and matching versions in `etc/requirements.txt`, and
GNU variants `sed` and `find`. An unsupported system will generate documentation
with changes, even when the underlying schema has not changed. `gendocs` works
best under Linux.

New schema files should automatically receive an entry in the index
`gencode/docs/readme.md` file if they are not referenced by any other schema
file. If a schema file is referenced by another schema file, but should still
have an entry in the index page, then the name should be added to the  to the
`ALWAYS_ROOT` list in `bin/gencode_root_schemas`.

Entries in the index `gencode/docs/readme.md` page sectioned according to the
value of `$section` in the schema file. The section must also exist in the
template `etc/schema_readme_template.md`, and must match (case sensitive) the
value of `$section`, otherwise the schema entry is inserted under the `Other`
section


## Releases

The `bin/upgrade_version` tool updates :
* the `$udmi_version` field in schema files,
* the version in `version` in `tests/**/*.json` according to manually curated file 
* documentation inline message examples.
* the `UDMI_VERSION` constant in specific JAVA files.

File in the `tests` directory must be listed in `etc/upversion.txt`. Only files
which are preceded by a `y` in `upversion.txt` will have their version upgraded. Comments are supported after the file path, e.g.
`y tests/schemas/state/makemodel_upgrade.json tests message upgrade from v1`

`bin/upgrade_version` carries out several checks on files which must be cleared before an update.

`bin/upgrade_version` does not update any generated files (e.g. for CI testing, refer to below list.)

An entry for the new version must be added manually in `common/src/main/java/com/google/udmi/util/SchemaVersion.java`

The entry in `validator/src/main/java/com/google/daq/mqtt/util/ConfigUtil.java` must be updated.

The below files need to be updated. Do not blindly copy! Inspect all diffs and confirm they are expected
* After `bin/test_trace simple`, contents of `sites/udmi_site_model/sites/out`
  into `tests/traces/simple/expected` 
* After `bin/test_validator`, `/tmp/validator.out` into `/etc/validator.out` (reset any changes to sites/udmi_site_model first and and run `bin/registrar`) 
* After `bin/test_registrar && bin/test_sites`, the `out` directory for each device in `tests/downgrade.site/devices/` into the `expected` subdirectory
  (note these files are ignored by git, but must still be committed)

**Useful commands**

* `rm -rf tests/sites/*/**/*/out && rm -rf tests/sites/*/out` to remove out files from `bin/test_registrar`

The workflow can be tested with an empty commit
(`git commit --allow-empty -m "Blank commit to trigger CI"; git push`).
On an unmodified branch, these tests should pass if correctly configured
