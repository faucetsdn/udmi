# Registrar Overview

The `registrar` is a utility program that registers and updates devices in Cloud IoT.
Running `bin/registrar` will validate local metadata and (optionally) register devices
in a cloud project.

See the [setup docs](setup.md) for common setup required for running this tool.

The [site model](../specs/site_model.md) documentation covers the basic structure of the
site-specific configuration. Ideally, this directory would be placed under
source control as a site-specific repo.

## Theory Of Operation

* The target set of _expected_ devices is determined from directory entries in
<code>_{site_path}_/devices/</code>.
* Existing devices that are not listed in the site config are blocked (as per
Cloud IoT device setting).
* Devices not found in the target registry are automatically created.
* Existing device registy entries are unblocked and updated with the new configuration.
* Various intermediate and summary files are written to the site directory. Typically,
these can be safely committed to source control as they are deterministic.

## Device Metadata & Keys

The expected model of a device is defined by a [device metadata](../specs/metadata.md) file,
along with a public key for that device (required for communication with the cloud).
Devices (that aren't proxied by a gateway) that do not auto-generate a public key
can use the [bin/keygen](keygen.md) utility to create a proper public/private key pair.

## Tool Execution

The registrar tool can be run locally to just validate the metadata, or with an optional
`project_id` to specify a target GCP project. Additional command-line arguments can
be used to specific specific device(s) to register (rather than all).

Usage: `bin/registrar site_path [project_id] [devices...]`

* `site_path`: The directory containing the site model.
* `project_id`: The (optional) GCP project ID that contains the target registry
* `devices`: Multiple device entries for limited registration. Can be just the device name
(`AHU-12`), or path to device (`site/devices/AHU-12`) for use with file-name glob.

Running the tool will create some output files for each device, and also a top-level
`registration_summary.json` file with summary results. Detailed error reports (if any)
for individual devices will be in their respective device directories.

## Sequence Diagram

Expected workflow to configure a registry using Registrar:

* `Device`: Target IoT Device
* `Local`: Local clone of site configuration repo
* `Registrar`: This utility program
* `Registry`: Target Cloud IoT Core registry
* `Repo`: Remote site configuration repo

All operations are manaul except those involving the `Registrar` tool.
