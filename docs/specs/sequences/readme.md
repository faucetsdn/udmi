# Sequences

Sequences are defined device behavior which are formulated from a series of events or communication messages.
They can be tested using the [`sequencer` tool](../../tools/sequencer.md). The
[generated steps](generated.md) for each test detail exactly what the tool actually checks.

## Functional Sequences

More explanatory detail for some of the key functional specifications:

- [Config and State](config.md): Basic handling of _config_ and _state_ messages.
- [Discovery](discovery.md): Flow for on-prem network and point discovery.
- [Writeback](writeback.md): Ability to control on-prem resouces from the cloud.
