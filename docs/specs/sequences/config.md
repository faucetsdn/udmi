# Config & State Sequence

* The [`state`](../../messages/state.md) and [`config`](../../messages/config.md) messages work together to represent
  a transactional state between the cloud and device.
* When any `config` is received, a `state` update should be generated with a corresponding last_update.
* The state message should be sent within 5 seconds
  * If additional processing is required, then the `updating` flag should be set `true`.
  * `updating` should be returned to `false` (or absent) once the device is done updating.
* The device can asynchronously update `state` if some other condition changes independent of
  `config` message, including when:
  * There is an update from an external source, e.g. a BMS or local controller
  * There is an update from internal logic
* Other [sequences](./) such as [writeback](writeback.md) may have specific behaviors relating to
  state messages
* A device should of continuously operating when receiving an erroneous config message. The

## Config Message

* `timestamp`: Server-side timestamp of when the config was generated.
* `system`: Subsystem for system-level information.
* ...: Other subsystems as defined in the standard (e.g. _pointset_ or _gateway_).

## State Message

* `system`:
  * `last_config`: Server-side timestamp from the last processed `config`.
  * `updating`: Boolean indicating if the system is still processing the last `config` update.

## Erroneous Config Handling

A device should be capable of interpreting erroneous messages without disrupting operation. There are
three types of errors which may be encountered when interpreting config messages:
* Hard-errors
* Soft-errors
* Non-errors

This behavior is tested by the `config` [sequencer](../../tools/sequencer.md) tests.

### Hard-errors

Hard errors are ones such that the sanity of the entire config block is held in question, and
considered "invalid" at a core level. This can happen when:
  * Only in response to config update message received
  * Payload does not pass JSON parsing
  * Missing "required" parameters (e.g. top-level version field)
  * NOT by unrecognized extra JSON fields

When this happens, the device should:
  * Keep the previous config (and use it) as a "steady state"
  * The state system.last_update time should not be updated
  * Appropriate error message included in system.statuses.config
  * All other status blocks (pointset, etcâ€¦) should remain unaffected

## Soft-errors

Are things that can be safely relegated to a specific sub-block (e.g. pointset) without other areas
being affected. This can happen when:
  * Invalid operations are indicated (e.g. writeback to non-writable point)
  * There is no blanket conditions for all subblocks (just depends)
  * Possibly independent of config (internal to device changes)
  * Can happen to multiple subblocks independently

When this happens, the device should:
  * Update system.last_config with last config.timestamp (config change)
  * Indicate relevant error (most significant) in system.statuses.{subblock}
  * Indicate more error detail (if any) in irrelevant state sunblock
  * Include additional error information in log messages (if appropriate)
  * Continue operating as best possible given the specified (invalid) config

## Non-Errors

There are some things that are specifically non-errors, and essentially meant to enable/help with
backwards compatibility. This can happen when:
  * There is an extra unknown field in a config json message.

When this happens, the device should:
  * Silently ignore the extra field(s) as if there was nothing wrong.
  * Generally can be implemented by setting some JSON parsers to "ignore unrecognized fields"
