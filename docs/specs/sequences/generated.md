# Generated sequences

These are the exact sequences being checked by the sequence tool. They are programmatically generated
so maybe a bit cryptic, but they accurately represent the specific steps required for each test.

<!--

To regenerate the contents of this file below, first generate a message trace sequence and then run bin/gencode_seq

* Running "bin/test_sequencer target-gcp-project" will run through the complete battery of test sequences
  against the AHU-1 device to create the requisite trace files. This takes about 4 min for a complete test run.

* Then run "bin/gencode_seq" which consumes the generated trace files and creates "generated.md" (this file)
  with the output. The diff (using git, usually) should then reflect the changes against the committed version.

Some caveats:

* Flaky tests are annoying. Sometimes something goes wrong and one entire test will be borked. Easist thing
  is to just re-run the sequence tests until it's clean, but that's not always the fastest.

* The gencode part requires a complete test run to work properly, but you can run individual test runs
  as needed, e.g. "bin/sequencer sites/udmi_site/model target-gcp-project AHU-1 21632 system_last_update"
  (you will need to run an instance of pubber separately).
