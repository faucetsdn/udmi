# Device Gateway

The _gateway_ functionality is used for systems that have legacy, heritage,
or traditional devices that do not communicate directly to the cloud using
a MQTT/UDMI connection. For example, an older [BACnet](http://www.bacnet.org/)
based system could use a gateway to translate on-prem communications into UDMI.

The
[Google Cloud IoT Core Gateway Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/gateways)
provides an overview of the cloud-side implementation of a gateway. UDMI, then,
specifies an additional layer of specification around the associated
message formats.

Conceptually, there are two types of
entities involved: the _gateway device_, and the _proxied device_. Both of
these are 'devices' in the sense that they have an entry in a cloud registry
and have device-level UDMI data, but they have fundamentally different roles.

## Gateway Operation

There are two modes for gateway operation: _implicit_ and _explicit_. 

In the _explicit_ mode, the gateway functionality is configured dynamically through
gateway _config_ messages, which tell it the local devices it should proxy for. 

In the _implicit_ gateway configuration, the gateway will be directly
configured to proxy a set of devices, essentially ignoring any gateway
information in the associated _config_ block.

The general sequence of events for gateway operation is:
1. Optional metadata specifies configuration parameters that should be used
at install time to properly (manually) setup the device.
2. (_explicit_ only) On startup, the gateway connects to the cloud and receives
a configuration block that details which _proxy devices_ the gateway should proxy for.
4. Gateway 'attaches' (Cloud IoT terminology) to the proxied devices,
receiving a configuration block for each proxied device. Any attach errors are
indicated in the gateway _status_ block and sent along as a _logentry_ event.
5. (_explicit_ only) The proxied device's _config_ block specifies any local
connection parameters for the proxied device, e.g. the BacNET device id.
6. The gateway proxies communication to/from the device, translating between
native (e.g. BacNET) communications and UDMI-based messages.

### config

[_Gateway Config Full Example_](../../tests/config.tests/gateway.json)

The [ðŸ§¬gateway block](../../gencode/docs/config.html#gateway) in the [config](../messages/config.md)
simply specifies the list of target proxy devices. On a config update, the gateway is responsible
for handling any change in this list (added or removed devices). The details of proxied devices are
kept to a minimum here (IDs only) to avoid overflowing the allowed block size in cases where there
are a large number of devices.

### state

[_Gateway State Full Example_](../../tests/state.tests/gateway.json)

Any attach errors, e.g. the gateway can not successfully attach to the target
device, should be reported in the [`gateway` _block_](../../gencode/docs/state.html#gateway) of the [state](../messages/state.md) message

A [_ðŸ§¬logentry_](../../gencode/docs/event_system.html#logentries)) message should be used to detail
the nature of the problem. If the gateway can attach successfully, any other errors, e.g. the
inability to communicate with the device over the local network, should be indicated as part of the
proxy device status block.

### telemetry

[Telemetry](../messages/event.md) from the gateway would primarily consist of standard messages,
which provide a running commentary about gateway operation. Specifically, if there is an error
attaching, then there should be appropriate logging to help diagnose the problem.

### metadata

[_Gateway Metadata Full Example_](../../tests/metadata.tests/gateway.json) 

The [ðŸ§¬`gateway` block](../../gencode/docs/metadata.html#gateway) within the [metadata](metadata.md)
specifies any information necessary either for the initial (manual) configuration of the device or
ongoing validation of operation. E.g., if a gateway device has a unique MAC address used for local
communications, it would be indicated here.

## Proxy Device Operation

Proxy devices are those that have a logical cloud device entry (in a registry),
and are associated (bound) to a particular gateway. On-prem, the device
itself talks a local protocol (e.g. BacNET), but does not have a direct
cloud connection.

### config

[_Proxy Device Full Config Example_](../../tests/config.tests/proxy.json) 

Proxy device [_config_](../messages/config.md) contain a special
[ðŸ§¬`localnet` block](../../gencode/docs/config.html#localnet) section that
specifies information required by the gateway to contact the local device.
E.g., the fact that a device is 'BacNET' and also the device's BacNET object
ID. Based on this, the gateway can communicate with the target device and proxy
all other messages.

Additionally, the gateway is responsible for proxying all other supported operations of the config
bundle. E.g., if a [_pointset_](../messages/pointset.md) has a
[ðŸ§¬`set_value`](../../gencode/docs/config.html#pointset_points_pattern1_set_value) 
parameter specified, the gateway would need to convert that into the local protocol
and trigger the required functionality.

### state

There is no gateway-specific [_state_](../messages/state.md) information, but similar to
[_config_](../messages/config.md) the gateway is responsible for proxying all relevant state from
the local device into the proxied device's state block. E.g., if the device is in an alarm state,
then the gateway would have to transform that from the local format into the appropriate UDMI
message.

### telemetry

[Telemetry](../messages/pointset.md#telemetry) is handled similarly, with the gateway responsible for
proxying data from local devices through to UDMI. In many cases, this would be translating specific
device points into a [_pointset_ message](../../tests/event_pointset.tests/example.json).

### metadata

[_Proxy Device Full Metadata Example_](../../tests/metadata.tests/proxy.json)

The [ðŸ§¬`localnet` block](../../gencode/docs/metadata.html#localnet) within the [metadata](metadata.md)
describes the presence of the device on a local network. This can/should be used for initial
programming and configuration of the device, or to validate proper device configuration. The gateway
implementation itself would not directly deal with this block.
