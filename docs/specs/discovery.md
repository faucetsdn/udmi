# Discovery and Enumeration

There's two related processes that are used to extract the
'as built' state of a system, detailing the physical actualities
of a physical system:

* _discovery_ refers to the process of determining what devices
exist, and any correlation between address families. This is
essentially extrinsic to a device itself.

* _enumeration_ refers to the listing of properties/points of a given
target device. This is essentially information intrinsic to a
device.

These two stages occur hand-in-hand, but are distinct constructs that
can be executed independently (i.e., there can be _discovery_ without
_enumeration_, and _enumeration_ without _discovery_).
