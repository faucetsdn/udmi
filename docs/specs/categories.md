# Entry Error Categories

Categories are assembled in a hierarchical fashion to represent the intended level
of detail (more specific is better). E.g. a complete system config parsing message
would be categorized as `system.config.parse`, while a system config entry of
unspecified category would be just `system.config`. Defined categories come with
implicit expected `level` values, indicated by '(**LEVEL**)' in the hierarchy below,
this is _not_ to say it's the only level allowed for that category, but rather
that is the expected normal value for that category. E.g., `pointset.point.nominal`
could be used with a **WARNING** level for a warning case during normal operation.
