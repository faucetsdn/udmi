# Sequence Validator Setup

The UDMI sequence validator tool monitors a sequence of messages from a device's stream and 
validates that the composition of sequential messsages is compliant with the UDMI Schema

1.  Ensure you have [deployed the necessary cloud functions](dashboard.md) to your GCP project
2.  Add a new GCP IoT Core registry with a registry ID of `UDMS-REFLECT`. 
    *   Use `udmi_reflect` as the default PUB/SUB topic for this registry. 
    *   This serves as a _reflector_ of the MAIN IoT registry combining all messages 
        published into a single stream. 
3.  Create credentials for a reflector device which you will shorlty in the new registry
    *   On your local machine, run `mkdir reflector` in your UDMI directory
    *   Run `bin/keygen RS256 reflector` to create a public and private key which will be
        stored in the `reflector` directory
3.  Add a new device to the `UDMS-REFLECT` registry with the followong configuration:
    *   device_id: Use the `<Registry ID>` as defined in Site Model for the devices to be tested>`
    *   auth_key: Use the public key you just created from `reflector/rsa_public.pem`
4.  Configure the sequence test by creating a file named `validator_config.json` in your UDMI
    root directory, or update the file if it exists to correspond to the new device under test
    ```
    {
    "project_id": "<PROJECT_ID>",
    "site_model": "<PATH_TO_SITE_MODEL>",
    "device_id": "<DEVICE_ID>",
    "serial_no": "<SERIAL_NO>",
    "key_file": "reflector/rsa_private.pkcs8"
    }
    ```
    *   `<PROJECT_ID>` is the ID of the GCP project the registry is located within 
    *   `<PATH_TO_SITE_MODEL>` is the path to the site model locally on your machine
        e.g. `../site_model`
    *   `<DEVICE_ID>` is the ID of the device to be tested, e.g. `AHU-9`
    *   `<SERIAL_NO>` is the serial number to be assossciated with state messages, 
        should a random number prefixed by `sequence-`, e.g. `sequencer-18241`
    *   _key_file_ is the path to the private key created earlier for the device, which 
        is `reflector/rsa_private.pkcs8` if you followed the earlier instructions

## Running Test Validator 

To run the sequence validator use the command
`java -cp validator/build/libs/validator-1.0-SNAPSHOT-all.jar org.junit.runner.JUnitCore com.google.daq.mqtt.validator.validations.BaselineValidator`

To run sequence testing suite with built-in pubber, run the `bin/setup_validator` 
to configure the test, and run `bin/test_sequences`. In a seperate window, run the 
commmand `tail -f pubber.out` to view the live pubber output
