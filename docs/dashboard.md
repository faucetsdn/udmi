# UDMI Dashboard

The UDMI dashboard is a very simple dashboard that can be used to view and browse 
device-specific data. Deploying the dashboard will deploy additional cloud functions, 
including:
*    Functions to show how data can be made more persistent, by  being written to a 
     back-end database, e.g. Firestore. See the `udmi_target` and `udmi_state` 
     [example cloud functions](../dashboard/functions/index.js) for details.
*    A function called `device_config` shows how PubSub can be used to update the Cloud IoT configuration.

## Setting Up the UDMI Dashboard

There are three four, which are needed at different stages
of deployment/updates.
1. _Initial setup of Firebase_ (for deploying the dashboard)
2. _Code deploy_ (to deploy a new or updated version of the code)
3. _Authentication_ (to authenticate any new users to the web page)

### Initial Setup

1.  Ensure you have [set up the GCP Cloud environment](cloud_setup.md) as required 
2.  Create a Firebase project linked to the GCP account
    *   Goto the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and click
        add a new project.
    *   Click the text field to enter your project name. A prompt to _Add Firebase to
        one of your existing Google Cloud projects_ will appear. Ensure you select your 
        existing GCP project
    *   Choose an appropriate billing option. The _Blaze_ plan should be fine.
    *   Disable Google Analytics, unless you also want to setup an account for that.
    *   Continue on to add Firebase to your GCP project.
3.  Enable a native mode database
    *   Goto the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) 
    *   Select your project.
    *   Select `Firestore Database` from the options on the left.
    *   Select to start the database in production mode.
    *   Select a location for the database - this should be the same geography as your 
        GCP IoT Core Registry
4.  Add a web-app to the Firebase project
    *   https://console.firebase.google.com/
    *   Select your project.
    *   Select "+ Add app" (or this may be auto-selected for you).
    *   Select "</>" (Web) to add a new web-app.
    *   Use a suitable nickname and register app. 
    *   Ensure _Firebase Hosting_ is enabled by ticking the checkbox to _Also set up 
        Firebase Hosting for this app._
    *   Skip the part about adding the Firebase SDK.
    *   Follow the instructions for installing the Firebase CLI. (refer to step below
        for additional information)
    *   Ignore the bit about "Deploy to Firebase Hosting" for now.
5.  Install the Firebase CLI on your local machine
    *   Follow the instructions 
    https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/?authuser=0#install-cli-mac-linux
    *   Make sure `npm` is installed.
6.  Get your [firebase config object](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/7015592?authuser=0) 
    for a _web app_.
    *   Click on Project Settings 
    *   Scroll down to "Your Apps"
    *   Under _Firebase SDK Snippet_ select _Config_
    *   Copy the `const firebaseConfig = { ... }` snippet to `dashboard/public/firebase_config.js`
7.  Add an API key restriction:
    *   Go to [API Key Restriction](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
    *   There should be an _API Keys_ with the name  _Browser key (auto created by Firebase)_
    *   Edit this, and add an _HTTP Referrer_ configured for any URL within your web 
        app address using a wildcard asterisk (*), for example `https://your-project-name.web.app/*`
    *   Your Web App address is given when enabling Firebase Web Hosting, and can be retrieved
8.  Enable Google sign-in for your Firebase We App
    *   https://console.firebase.google.com/
    *   Select your project.
    *   Select "Authentication"
    *   Select "Sign-in method"
    *   Enable "Google" sign-in.

### Code Deploy

1.  Install Firebase function dependencies.
    *   Make sure `npm` is installed.
    *   `cd` to the `dashboard/functions` directory and run `npm install`.
2.  `cd` to the `dashboard` directory, run `deploy_dashboard <project id>` where project ID is 
    the firebase project ID to deploy to your project.
    *   Follow the link to the indicated _Hosting URL_ to see the newly installed pages.
    *   You will likely see an _Authentication failed_ message. See next section for details.

### Authentication

1.  Have intended user access the page page and login using a Google Account (the authentication 
    will fail at this stage)
2.  From the Firebase Console, click on _Authentication_ in the side bar, and identify the 
    `User UID` of the intended account
3.  Enable access for the user within the Dashboard application
    *   From the Firebase Console, click on _Firestore Database_. 
    *   Click on the users collection
    *   Click document which matches the `User UID` you are granting access for
    *   Add a new Collection under this user
        *   CollectionID: `iam`
        *   Document ID: `default`
        *   Field `enabled` = (boolean) `true`
