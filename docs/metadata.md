# Metadata Description File

A device's `metadata.json` is a description about the device: a specification
about how the device should be configured and expectations about what the device
should be doing. It is used to provide the basic information for registering
devices in a IoT Core registry, generation of other template files (e.g.
_config_ block) associated with the device, and as a means for runtime
validation of what the device is actually sending.

The `metadata.json` files are stored in a `devices/{device_id}` directory
with an expected 1:1 mapping between device directory and device entry
in a IoT Core registry.

## System Tooling

There are three main sets of tools that rely on the `metadata.json` file,
all found in the UDMI `bin/` directory.
* [`genkeys`](keygen.md): Generates public/private device key pairs (optional as needed).
* [`registrar`](registrar.md): Validates metadata files and can (optionally) register devices.
* [`validator`](validator.md): Validates live data stream from devices.

## Output Files

The various tools will generate some output files in the same `devices/` directory:
* `rsa_*`: Device public/private key files (`genkeys` tool).
* `metadata_norm.json`: Normalized version of the `metadata.json` file (`registrar` tool).
* `generated_config.json`: Default device IoT Core `config` block (`registrar` tool).
* `errors.json`: Detailed error file (`registrar` tool).

## Metadata Structure

The structure of the metadata file is shown in the [metadata schema](https://faucetsdn.github.io/udmi/gencode/docs/metadata.html)
