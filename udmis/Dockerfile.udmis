# There's some bad interaction between alpine and netty with java, which
# causes the JVM to segfault. Not fun. None of the suggested fixes on the
# internetz seemed to work completely. For now, switching to ubuntu fixes this,
# but isn't the right long term solution b/c alpine is better in terms of
# security vunerability handling.
#
# See https://www.couchbase.com/forums/t/java-sdk-crashes-the-jvm-on-alpine-docker-image/32603/4
# for a discussion of a fix (tmpfs) that works with Docker but NOT with GKE.
#
# TODO: Convert this to use alpine base image and make sure it works.
