# This is a list of files that are (or might be) externally referenced.
# This list is automatically checked, and if a file goes missing an error will be raised!
# The first word is an explicit file path to check existence of, and the remainder is a comment/description.
# This is not sophisticated enough to check the _usage_ of any files.
