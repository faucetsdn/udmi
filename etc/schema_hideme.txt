# Properties to hide from human readable schema documentation
#
# There are some properties in the schema now which are part of the 
# cloud sub-block processing, but are not expected to be published by devices.
# Prime examples include `timestamp` and `version` fields within each 
# sub-block within the state message, for example `state.pointset.version`.
# 
# The schema docunmentation then becomes very confusing when these fields
# are included, so this is a short term mitigation to just hide the following properties
#
# Usage:
# 
# {FILE} {PROPERTY TO HIDE (dot notation address)}
# e.g. state_pointset.json .timestamp

state_pointset.json .timestamp
state_pointset.json .version

state_gateway.json .timestamp
state_gateway.json .version

state_localnet.json .timestamp
state_localnet.json .version

state_mapping.json .timestamp
state_mapping.json .version

state_system.json .timestamp
state_system.json .version
