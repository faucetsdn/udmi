// This message represents the entire high-level config of a mapping recommendation model.
// This is essentially an "input" from the outside world that might be relevant to the mapper internals.
//
// The building id is defined by the message envelope.
//
// Basic comparisons are with values in the related state message block as a logical timestamp comparisons:
//   applied < promoted: This means a entry has been promoted but has not yet been applied by the external system
//   requested > exported: This means that an export has been requested but not yet triggered (mapper should export data)
