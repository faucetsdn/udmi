//
// This message represents the entire high-level config of a recommendation model,
// as given to the mapping component. It therefore reflects the external (to a mapping engine)
// view of what has happened outside of the mapping engine itself.
//
// The building id is defined by the message envelope.
//
// General overview of the external representation:
// 1. Applied: An exported recommendation was received and applied to the system.
// 2. Request: Last time an export was requested from the system.
//
// Comaprison of timestamps would trigger action by the external (non-mapper) system:
//   imported < applied: The system should import (send command) the applied mapping into the mapper
