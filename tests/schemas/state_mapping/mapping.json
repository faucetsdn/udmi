//
// This message represents the entire high-level state of a recommendation,
// as given by the mapping component. It therefore reflects the internal state
// of the mapper as might be of interest to the outside world.
//
// Note that building id is defined as part of the message envelope.
//
// General workflow is (not all steps will always be present):
// 1. Import: Existing mappings can be imported from an external source
// 2. Discovery: Mapper receives discovery message
// 3. Prediction: Internal algorithm predicts what it might be and gives options
// 4. Promotion: Some process for promoting a single option based on prediction
// 5. Export: Result of promotion are exported for external consumption
//
// Comparison of timestamps with the related config block would trigger action by the mapper:
//   requested > exported: The mapper should export (send event) the indicated mapping
