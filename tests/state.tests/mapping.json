//
// This message represents the entire high-level state of a mapping recommendation.
// Additional messages would be required to detail specific bits (e.g. what was
// discovered or the actual staged or promoted contents).
//
// Note that building id is included as part of the message envelope.
//
// Gendral gendral workflow is:
// 1. Mapper receives discovery message
// 2. Internal algorithm predicts what it might be and gives options
// 3. Some process for promoting a single option based on prediction
// 4. Result of promotion are exported for external consumption
